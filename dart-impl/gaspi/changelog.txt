ported dart-gaspi declarations to version 3.2 (former 3.1).

===dart_communitcation.c===
line 410: added dart_allgatherv for gaspi
line 1325: added dart_allreduce for gaspi
line 2020: added dart_ftech_and_op 
    TODO: Prints an "not supported" message only. Implementation is missing.
line 2029: added dart_accumulate
    TODO: Implementation is missing. Prints unsupported.

==dart_communication_priv.h===


==dart_communication_priv.c===
line 2: added include gaspi_utils.h to include reduce_ops and gaspi_reduce_user (defined in gaspi.utils.c/h)

===dart_group_impl.c===
line 201: added dart_group_locality_split

===gaspi_utils.h===
line 12: added header for function dart_gaspi_datatype_sizeof()
line 14: added header for function gaspi_reduce_user()
line 85: added function headers for gaspi reduce operations
line 306: added header for dart_type_create_strided
line 309: added header for dart_type_create_indexed
line 313: added header for dart_type_destroy


===gaspi_utils.c===
line 15: added function dart_gaspi_datatype_sizeof wich returns size of dart_datatype in bytes
line 32: added gaspi_reduce_user() and comment section which describes it.
     TODO: See comment.
line 873: added implementation of gaspi reduce operations 
line 1187: addded dart_type_create_strided
       Need to be implemented
line 1199: added dart_type_create_indexed
       Needs to be implemented
line 1212: added dart_type_destroy
       Needs to be implemented

== dart_globmem.c ==
line 161: added dart_team_memderegister
    DASH documantation says, it wont deallocate memory. In fact, gaspi only supports
    delete with similar deallocation of the segment. Therefore it will be dealocated
    if invoked in it's current implementation.
line 269: added dart_team_memregister

=== ex10.radixsort ===
added #if statement because it is a mpi-only test and fails. 

==TODO==
[ ] dart_adapt_teamlist_alloc seems to be defective. Teams seem to be allocated but the id is not assigned in the array. 
[ ] some funtions declared by DART version 3.2 are not implemented
[ ] dart_reduce and dart_allreduce for gaspi need optimization
[ ] all functionality around creating own dart_data_type types ar not working
[ ] dart_type_create in gaspi_utils.c, line 1187
[ ] dart_type_create_indexed in gaspi_utils.c, line 1199
[ ] dart_type_destroy in gaspi_utils.c, line 1212 
[ ] line 108 in dart_globmem.c: used DART_TYPE_BYTE to represent gaspi_segemnt_id_t. Maybe there is a better 
    solution.
[ ] line 323 in dart_globmem.c: used DART_TYPE_BYTE to represent gaspi_segemnt_id_t. Maybe there is a better
